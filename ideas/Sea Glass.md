# Sea Glass

## Materials

- Small pieces of colored glass (use safety goggles and gloves if breaking your own glass)
- Sandpaper (fine grit)
- Jar with saltwater or vinegar for a more “weathered” look

## Instructions

1. Select or carefully break colored glass (blue, green, clear) into small, smooth-edged pieces.
2. Sand the edges and surfaces lightly with fine-grit sandpaper to create a soft, worn look.
3. Place the glass in a jar with saltwater or vinegar for a few hours to add texture.
4. Rinse and dry. **Tip**: Add a sprinkle of glitter or iridescent powder for a mystical glow.
