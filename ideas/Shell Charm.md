# Shell Charm

## Materials Needed

- Small shells (with natural holes or drill a hole carefully)
- Thin cord, twine, or leather string
- Small beads (optional)

## Instructions

1. Select shells that are small enough to hang as charms.
2. Thread a length of cord or twine through the shellâ€™s hole.
3. Add a few small beads if desired, then tie a knot above and below the shell to secure it in place.
4. Finish by tying the ends into a loop or knot. For a magical touch, sprinkle a bit of shimmery powder on the shell.
