# Vial of Colored Sand

## Materials Needed

- Small glass vial with cork
- Different colors of fine sand or salt, dyed with food coloring
- Iridescent mica powder or a shimmer powder

## Instructions

1. Layer different colors of sand in the vial, alternating colors for a "layered" effect.
2. Between each layer, add a small pinch of iridescent powder to create a shifting glow in the sand.
3. Seal with a cork and tie a small piece of twine around the neck of the vial.
4. Shake gently to blend colors slightly, creating a mysterious color-changing effect.
