# Desert Flower Charm

## Materials Needed

- Polymer clay (yellow, red, pink, or purple for a desert flower look)
- Small sculpting tool or toothpick
- Jewelry ring or thin wire

## Instructions

1. Shape the clay into a tiny flower by creating small petals and attaching them around a center ball.
2. Use a toothpick to add texture to the petals, making them look like the fine details of a flower.
3. Carefully insert a jewelry ring or wire loop into the top of the flower.
4. Bake the clay according to the instructions, then let cool.
5. Optional: Paint with a translucent glitter glaze for a "magical desert bloom" look.
