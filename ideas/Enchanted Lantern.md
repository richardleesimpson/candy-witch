# Enchanted Lantern

## Materials Needed

- Clear glass jar
- Battery-operated fairy lights (warm or cool white)
- Iridescent cellophane or tissue paper (optional, for a glowing effect)
- Small natural items like leaves or acorns (optional)

## Instructions

1. Place the fairy lights inside the jar, with or without a layer of iridescent cellophane for extra glow.
