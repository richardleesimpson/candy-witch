# Swamp Witch

## Description

In swampy, mist-laden areas, the Candy Witch is believed to make her home in an ancient, twisted tree or a decayed cabin hidden in the dense brush. Her presence is often marked by sudden fogs, strange lights flickering in the swamp, and the haunting sound of frogs and owls quieting just before she arrives.

## Lore

The Swamp Witch is said to need candy to sweeten her potions, which are too bitter otherwise. Locals whisper that she uses the sweets to create charms for those lost in the swamp, helping guide them back to safety. Some believe she also shares the candy with swamp creatures—frogs, snakes, and will-o’-wisps—as payment for their help in her magic.

## Offerings

Children leave their candy at the edge of the swamp, sometimes nestled in a small wreath of leaves and moss, believing the Witch prefers natural offerings. In return, they may find a gift of swamp stones, strange herbs, or a small vial of "swamp mist" that glows faintly at night.
