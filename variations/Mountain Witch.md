# Mountain Witch

## Description

High in the mountains, the Candy Witch is rumored to live in an abandoned mine or an icy cave. Those who leave candy at the mountain's edge may hear whispers of her ancient spells echoing in the cold air.

## Lore

Legend says she was drawn to the mountains for the precious crystals buried deep inside, using their power to fuel her magic. Locals say she trades her candy for these crystals, explaining why she needs so much each Halloween.

## Offerings

Children leave their candy on rocks, often wrapped in silver paper or alongside small, shiny pebbles, believing the Witch is drawn to reflective surfaces. In return, they might find a small crystal, a carved stone amulet, or a piece of "mountain ice" that glows faintly in the moonlight.
