# Spirit World Witch

## Description

In places where the veil between worlds is believed to be thin, the Spirit World Witch exists in an ethereal realm only accessible on [[Halloween]] night. She may live in an ancient, forgotten cemetery or a phantom castle that only appears once a year. Legends say she drifts between our world and the spirit world like a shadow, slipping silently through the mist.

## Lore

The Spirit World Witch is thought to need candy to connect with the spirits, or as a form of currency in the spirit realm. Some believe the candy strengthens her powers, allowing her to perform acts of kindness for restless spirits. Others say she simply loves the taste, savoring each piece before vanishing back into the spirit world until next [[Halloween]].

## Offerings

Children leave their candy offerings at the entrance of cemeteries or under old trees, often with a candle nearby to guide the Witch to the treats. In return, they may find a charm, such as a [[Small Crystal]], a [[Ghostly Silver Coin]], or a [[Mysterious Key]] that "opens any door" but can never be used twice.
