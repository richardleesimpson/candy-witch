# Desert Witch

## Description

In arid regions, the [[Candy Witch]] is thought to hide among the desert dunes, appearing as a mirage in the moonlight. Her presence is marked by sudden desert blooms on Halloween night.

## Lore

Locals believe she gathers candy to sweeten her ancient potions, which she uses to call rain to the dry land once a year. Offerings left on the sand often disappear without a trace, leaving only her mysterious footprints.

## Offerings

Children leave their candy under stones or in small clay dishes by the sand dunes. In return, they may find a small [[Polished Rock]], a [[Desert Flower Charm]], or a [[Vial of Colored Sand]] that shifts shades mysteriously under different lights.
