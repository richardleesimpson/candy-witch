# Coastal Witch

## Description

In coastal areas, the Candy Witch is said to live in a small, weathered lighthouse by the sea, emerging only during low tide to collect her candy offerings.

## Lore

Stories say she needs the candy to appease sea spirits or make spells that calm the ocean's storms. On Halloween night, kids sometimes leave candy on the sand, watching as the waves slowly carry it away.

## Offerings

Children leave candy on driftwood or in shells along the shore, sometimes tying it with seaweed as a "gift wrap." In return, they may find a piece of sea glass, a small shell charm, or even a pearl-like bead that is said to bring protection over water.
