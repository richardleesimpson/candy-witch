# Island Witch

## Description

On tropical islands, legends say the [[Candy Witch]] hides in caves along the coast, emerging under the full moon to collect candy offerings left by the beach.

## Lore

Island lore suggests she needs candy to communicate with ancient sea spirits or to create potions that allow her to swim among the mermaids. On [[Halloween]] night, kids leave candy on palm leaves to keep her happy.

## Offerings

Candy is left in palm leaves, surrounded by tropical flowers or small shells. In return, children may find a tiny [[Shell Necklace]], a [[Deepwater Stone|smooth stone from the ocean depths]], or a small [[Mermaid's Tear Gem]] said to bring good luck on the water.
