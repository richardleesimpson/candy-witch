# Urban Witch

## Description

In urban legends, the Candy Witch is a more modern figure, dwelling in hidden corners of the city. Some say sheâ€™s disguised as a night-shift worker, others claim she hides in graffiti-tagged alleys.

## Lore

It's believed she collects candy to share with spirits who roam the city at night. Some families leave candy near street corners, hoping to catch a glimpse of her as she silently collects her offerings.

## Offerings

Candy is often left by streetlamps, under benches, or at the bases of buildings, tucked into small envelopes or colorful bags. In return, children might find a small trinket like a keychain, a button with strange symbols, or a "lucky" subway token that glows faintly under the light.
