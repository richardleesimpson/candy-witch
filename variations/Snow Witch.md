# Snow Witch

## Description

In snowy regions, the Candy Witch is said to live in a remote cabin deep in the forest. She leaves tracks in the snow that vanish as mysteriously as they appear.

## Lore

Some say she collects candy to keep warm or as fuel for her cauldron fires. Others believe she uses it to charm snow creatures or to leave small, magical snowflakes as gifts in exchange for the candy.

## Offerings

Children leave their candy in snowdrifts or by the bases of pine trees, often wrapping it in white or silver cloth so it blends with the snow. In return, they might find a [[Snowflake Charm]], a smooth [[Ice Stone]], or a tiny [[Frosted Glass Animal Figure|carved animal made of frosted glass]].
