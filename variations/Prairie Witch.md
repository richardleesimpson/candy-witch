# Prairie Witch

## Description

Known as a quiet, watchful figure in open plains, the Prairie Witch is rumored to live in an abandoned farmhouse surrounded by whispering fields.

## Lore

Locals say she walks silently through the fields, drawn by the scent of candy. She’s believed to befriend the animals of the prairie, offering them treats in exchange for their help during her Halloween journeys.

## Offerings

Children leave candy nestled in tufts of tall grass or tied in small burlap sacks. In return, they may find a small charm of woven wheat, a tiny carved animal figure, or a "prairie stone" that brings good fortune.
