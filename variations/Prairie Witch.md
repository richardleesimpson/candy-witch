# Prairie Witch

## Description

Known as a quiet, watchful figure in open plains, the Prairie Witch is rumored to live in an abandoned farmhouse surrounded by whispering fields.

## Lore

Locals say she walks silently through the fields, drawn by the scent of candy. Sheâ€™s believed to befriend the animals of the prairie, offering them treats in exchange for their help during her [[Halloween]] journeys.

## Offerings

Children leave candy nestled in tufts of tall grass or tied in small burlap sacks. In return, they may find a small [[Charm of Woven Wheat]], a tiny [[Carved Animal Figure]], or a [[Prairie Stone]] that brings good fortune.
