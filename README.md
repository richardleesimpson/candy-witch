# Candy Witch Halloween Lore

The bigger the offering, the greater the reward, creating a magical incentive for generosity. 

These files detail the lore, [[gift ideas]], and [[regional variations]] surrounding the Candy Witch, providing a structure that can be expanded or personalized. You can add your own here, making this a fun collaborative project for friends and family.
